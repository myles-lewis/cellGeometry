\arguments{
\item{mk}{object of class 'cellMarkers'. See \code{\link[=cellMarkers]{cellMarkers()}}.}

\item{test}{matrix of bulk RNA-Seq to be deconvoluted. We recommend raw
counts as input, but normalised data can be provided, in which case set
\code{log = FALSE}.}

\item{log}{Logical, whether to apply log2 +1 to count data in \code{test}. Set to
\code{FALSE} if prenormalised bulk RNA-Seq data is provided.}

\item{count_space}{Logical, whether deconvolution is performed in count
space (as opposed to log2 space). Signature and test revert to count scale
by 2^ exponentiation during deconvolution.}

\item{comp_amount}{either a single value from 0-1 for the amount of
compensation or a numeric vector with the same length as the number of cell
subclasses to deconvolute.}

\item{group_comp_amount}{either a single value from 0-1 for the amount of
compensation for cell group analysis or a numeric vector with the same
length as the number of cell groups to deconvolute.}

\item{weights}{Optional vector of weights which affects how much each gene in
the gene signature matrix affects the deconvolution.}

\item{weight_method}{Optional. Choices include "equal" in which case weights
are calculated so that each gene has equal weighting in the vector
projection; "none"; or "irw" which enables iterative reweighting of genes
based on residuals (see details). Setting this overrules any vector
supplied by \code{weights}.}

\item{adjust_comp}{logical, whether to optimise \code{comp_amount} to prevent
negative cell proportion projections.}

\item{use_filter}{logical, whether to use denoised signature matrix.}

\item{arith_mean}{logical, whether to use arithmetic means (if available) for
signature matrix. Mainly useful with pseudo-bulk simulation.}

\item{convert_bulk}{either "ref" to convert bulk RNA-Seq to scRNA-Seq scaling
using reference data or "qqmap" using quantile mapping of the bulk to
scRNA-Seq datasets, or "none" (or \code{FALSE}) for no conversion.}

\item{check_comp}{logical, whether to analyse compensation values across
subclasses.}

\item{npass}{Number of passes. If \code{npass} set to 2 or more this activates
removal of genes with excess variance of the residuals.}

\item{outlier_method}{Method for identifying outlying genes. Options are to
use the variance of the residuals for each genes, Cook's distance or
absolute Studentized residuals (see details).}

\item{outlier_cutoff}{Cutoff for removing genes which are outliers based on
method selected by \code{outlier_method}.}

\item{outlier_quantile}{Controls quantile for the cutoff for identifying
outliers for \code{outlier_method = "cook"} or \code{"rstudent"}.}

\item{verbose}{logical, whether to show messages.}

\item{cores}{Number of cores for parallelisation via \code{parallel::mclapply()}.}

\description{
Deconvolution of bulk RNA-Seq using vector projection method with adjustable
compensation for spillover.
}
\details{
Equal weighting of genes by setting \code{weight_method = "equal"} can help
devolution of subclusters whose signature genes have low expression. It is
enabled by default.

Multipass deconvolution can be activated by setting \code{npass} to 2 or higher.
This is designed to remove genes which behave inconsistently due to noise in
either the sc or bulk datasets, which is increasingly likely if you have
larger signature geneset, i.e. if \code{nsubclass} is large. Or you may receive a
warning message "Detected genes with extreme residuals". Three methods are
available for identifying outlier genes (i.e. whose residuals are too noisy)
controlled by \code{outlier_method}:
\itemize{
\item \code{var.e}, this calculates the variance of the residuals across samples for
each gene. Genes whose variance of residuals are outliers based on Z-score
standardisation are removed during successive passes.
\item \code{cooks}, this considers the deconvolution as if it were a regression and
applies Cook's distance to the residuals and the hat matrix. This seems to be
the most stringent method (removes fewest genes).
\item \code{rstudent}, externally Studentized residuals are used.
}

The cutoff specified by \code{outlier_cutoff} which is used to determine which
genes are outliers is very sensitive to the outlier method. With \code{var.e} the
variances are Z-score scaled. With Cook's distance it is typical to consider
a value of >1 as fairly strong indication of an outlier, while 0.5 is
considered a possible outlier. With Studentized residuals, these are expected
to be on a t distribution scale. However, since gene expression itself does
not derive from a normal distribution, the errors and residuals are not
normally distributed either, which probably explains the need for a very high
cut-off. In practice the choice of settings seems to be dataset dependent.
