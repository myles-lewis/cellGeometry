\arguments{
\item{scdata}{Single-cell data matrix with genes in rows and cells in
columns. Can be sparse matrix or DelayedMatrix. Must have rownames
representing gene IDs or gene symbols.}

\item{bulkdata}{Optional data matrix containing bulk RNA-Seq data with genes
in rows. This matrix is only used for its rownames (gene IDs), to ensure
that cell markers are selected from genes in the bulk dataset.}

\item{subclass}{Vector of cell subclasses matching the columns in \code{scdata}}

\item{cellgroup}{Optional grouping vector of major cell types matching the
columns in \code{scdata}. \code{subclass} is assumed to contain subclasses which are
subsets within \code{cellgroup} overarching classes.}

\item{nsubclass}{Number of genes to select for each single cell subclass.
Either a single number or a vector with the number of genes for each
subclass.}

\item{ngroup}{Number of genes to select for each cell group. Either a single
number or a vector with the number of genes for each group.}

\item{expfilter}{Genes whose maximum mean expression on log2 scale per cell
type are below this value are removed and not considered for the signature.}

\item{noisefilter}{Sets an upper bound for \code{noisefraction} cut-off below
which gene expression is set to 0. Essentially gene expression above this
level must be retained in the signature. Setting this higher can allow more
suppression via \code{noisefraction} and can favour more highly expressed genes.}

\item{noisefraction}{Numeric value. Maximum mean log2 gene expression across
cell types is calculated and values in celltypes below this fraction are
set to 0. Set in conjunction with \code{noisefilter.} Note: if this is set too
high (too close to 1), it can have a deleterious effect on deconvolution.}

\item{min_cells}{Numeric value specifying minimum number of cells in a
subclass category. Subclass categories with fewer cells will be ignored.}

\item{remove_subclass}{Character vector of \code{subclass} levels to be removed
from the analysis.}

\item{dual_mean}{Logical whether to calculate arithmetic mean of counts as
well as mean(log2(counts +1)). This is mainly useful for simulation.}

\item{meanFUN}{Function for applying mean which is passed to \code{\link[=scmean]{scmean()}}. Options
include \code{logmean} (the default) or \code{trimmean} which is a trimmed after
excluding the top/bottom 5\% of values.}

\item{postFUN}{Optional function applied to \code{genemeans} matrices after mean
has been calculated. If \code{meanFUN} is set to \code{trimmean}, then \code{postFUN}
needs to be set to \code{log2s}. See \code{\link[=scmean]{scmean()}}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical whether to show messages.}

\item{cores}{Integer, number of cores to use for parallelisation using
\code{mclapply()}. Parallelisation is not available on windows. Warning:
parallelisation has increased memory requirements. See \code{\link[=scmean]{scmean()}}.}

\item{big}{Logical whether to invoke matrix slicing to handle big matrices.}

\item{sliceSize}{Integer, number of rows of \code{x} to use in each slice if
\code{big = TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list object with S3 class 'cellMarkers' containing:
\item{call}{the matched call}
\item{best_angle}{named list containing a matrix for each cell type with
genes in rows. Rows are ranked by lowest specificity angle for that cell
type and highest maximum expression. Columns are:
\code{angle} the specificity angle in radians,
\code{angle.deg} the same angle in degrees,
\code{max} the maximum mean expression across all cell types,
\code{rank} the rank of the mean gene expression for that cell type compared to
the other cell types}
\item{group_angle}{named list of matrices similar to \code{best_angle}, for each
cell subclass}
\item{geneset}{character vector of selected gene markers for cell types}
\item{group_geneset}{character vector of selected gene markers for cell
subclasses}
\item{genemeans}{matrix of mean log2+1 gene expression with genes in rows
and cell types in columns}
\item{genemeans_filtered}{matrix of gene expression for cell types
following noise reduction}
\item{groupmeans}{matrix of mean log2+1 gene expression with genes in rows
and cell subclasses in columns}
\item{groupmeans_filtered}{matrix of gene expression for cell subclasses
following noise reduction}
\item{cell_table}{factor encoded vector containing the groupings of the
cell types within cell subclasses, determined by which subclass contains
the maximum number of cells for each cell type}
\item{spillover}{matrix of spillover values between cell types}
\item{subclass_table}{contingency table of the number of cells in each
subclass}
\item{qqmap}{'qqmap' class object generated by \code{\link[=quantile_map]{quantile_map()}} containing
quantile mapping from bulk to single-cell}
\item{opt}{list storing options, namely arguments \code{nsubclass}, \code{ngroup},
\code{expfilter}, \code{noisefilter}, \code{noisefraction}}
\item{genemeans_ar}{if \code{dual_mean} is \code{TRUE}, optional matrix of arithmetic
mean, i.e. log2(mean(counts)+1)}
\item{genemeans_filtered_ar}{optional matrix of arithmetic mean
following noise reduction}
The 'cellMarkers' object is designed to be passed to \code{\link[=deconvolute]{deconvolute()}} to
deconvolute bulk RNA-Seq data. It can be updated rapidly with different
settings using \code{\link[=updateMarkers]{updateMarkers()}}. Ensembl gene ids can be substituted for
recognisable gene symbols by applying \code{\link[=gene2symbol]{gene2symbol()}}.
}
\description{
Uses geometric method based on vector dot product to identify genes which are
the best markers for individual cell types.
