Description: Deconvolution of bulk RNA-Sequencing data into proportions of cells based on a reference single-cell RNA-Sequencing dataset using high-dimensional geometric methodology. Optimal gene markers are identified based on the minimal angle between the gene and the relevant cell type as a dimension calculated by arc cosine of mean log transformed gene expression scaled to a unit hypersphere with cell types as dimensions. Deconvolution is performed by dot product vector projection in space with a compensation matrix.
